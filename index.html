    <p class="small">i was born on December 4, 2007 in Spain, and I became fluent (or atleast understandable) in english by playing videogames (specially Minecraft) and attempting to chat online with english people. Online, I go by the name "miris" (but you probably know me as Fres, which was my username for more than a year)
I have some knowledge about programming (through I'm a novice), and -999 knowledge about geography.</p><p class="small"> I have a condition called Asperger's syndrome which doesn't really affect me online, but makes it hard for me to make friends irl (I only have 1 actual friend irl), but as you may see me online I'm a very friendly person and <span class="strikethrough">somewhat horny</span>, if you wanna be online friends I'll gladly be your friend as long as you don't have a serious criminal record or are rude to me, my discord is <i class="fab fa-discord" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="bold">doggers#4491</span> but i dont often dm with people, I rather talk in community servers so if you wanna talk with me click the below buttons to join my favorite talking servers I'm sure you'll like them too :)</p>
